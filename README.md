# 5110-project

Scripts i used to build and configure the servers for the techproj.  Pretty much everything from addressing to OUs and containers can be done with automation. Even DHCP scopes can be done this way. Admittidly, not everything is done with best practices in mind, you'll see a ton of plaintext passwords, so obviously don't do that unless you really want to have the shit hacked out of you. Some stuff is a little skectchy, just the way I like it. Most of it's preddy good though, and for the most part I'm proud of it. Have some fun with it...

Take a look, fork it, clone it, idgaf. Send copies to your aunties and grandma. Pls. 

But please don't steal my stuff without credit! I mean it's not like I can do anything about it but it's just an asshole move and you don't want to be THAT GUY. 

Probably not a good idea to use these for your own project, if you happen to be taking info-5110, since they'll probably do more harm than good unless your're reasonably experienced with PSH. And if you are, you can probably do way better than this idiot. 

Cheers,

ya boy; yabones.
